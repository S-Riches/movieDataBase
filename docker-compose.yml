# every docker compose file should start with what version is being used
# yml are similar to json files, but instead of declaring what type each data value is, yml reads each bit of data as a string and then sets it to a value
# yml also doesnt use commas, instead using new lines, and doesnt use brackets but indentation instead
# yml is slower than json which is why json is used for client / server due to its speed - whereas yml is used for configuration
