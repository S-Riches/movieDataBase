# Movie DataBase

Recently i created an API using .NET along with Docker and a few other pieces of technology at some work experience - since then i have had a huge interest in combining different parts of my knowledge into a full stack program, but due to my college course i had spent alot of time away from programming. Therefore i present my first attempt at an independent full stack application : **MovieDB**.

Using python for the backend and some different libraries i will be writing a few scripts to scrape different streaming websites that i use personally to tell me what is available for me to watch. For the frontend i will be using bootstrap along with vanilla javascript(undecided possibly could use react incase i want to make the interface more pretty) to present a nice interface. I will also be using SSMS to store information to cut down on computing power needed, as the scraping should only need to happen once a day at most.

I will also make a focus to use Docker to make my program more portable incase i ever want to show someone it.
